The recruitment and activation of fibroblasts to syn- thesize connective tissue proteins are driven by many growth factors, including PDGF, FGF-2 (described earlier), and TGF-b. The major source of these factors is inflamma- tory cells, paicularly macrophages, which are present at sites of injury and in granulation tissue. Sites of inflamma- tion are also rich in mast cells, and in the appropriate chemotactic milieu, lymphocytes may be present as well. Each of these cell types can secrete cytokines and growth factors that contribute to fibroblast proliferation and activation. As healing progresses, the number of proliferating fibroblasts and new vessels decreases; however, the fibro- blasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, so there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthe- sis, in paicular, is critical to the development of strength in a healing wound site. As described later, collagen syn- thesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3 to 5) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation, however, depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). Ulti- mately, the granulation tissue evolves into a scar composed of largely inactive, spindle-shaped fibroblasts, dense collagen, fragments of elastic tissue, and other ECM com- ponents (Fig. 2-30, B). As the scar matures, there is proA A gressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. Growth Factors Involved in ECM Deposition and Scar Formation Many growth factors are involved in these processes, including TGF-b, PDGF, and FGF. Because FGF also is involved in angiogenesis, it was described earlier. Here we briefly describe the major propeies of TGF-b and PDGF. * Transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) belongs to a family of homologous polypeptides (TGF-b1, -b2, and -b3) that includes other cytokines such as bone morphogenetic proteins. The TGF-b1 isoform is widely distributed and is usually referred to as TGF-b. The active factor binds to two cell surface receptors with serine-threonine kinase activity, triggering the phosphorylation of transcription factors called Smads. TGF-b has many and often oppo- site effects, depending on the cell type and the metabolic state of the tissue. In the context of inflammation and repair, TGF-b has two main functions: TGF-b stimulates the production of collagen, fibro- nectin, and proteoglycans, and it inhibits collagen degradation by both decreasing proteinase activity and increasing the activity of tissue inhibitors of pro- teinases known as TIMPs (discussed later on).

Diastolic blood pressure Aerial hypeension is the result of abnormal flow/resistance relationships. Resistance to outflow consists of different components: the systolic component is the one generated by conductance vessels, whereas the diastolic component consists of peripheral resistance, which regulates peripheral blood supply due to the run-off of conductance vessels during left ventricular diastole. Thus, an increase in systemic resistance results in a rise in diastolic blood pressure. If the elasticity of conductance vessels decreases, diastolic run-off also decreases and diastolic blood pressure goes down. When this loss of elasticity occurs, the ejection force cannot be anymore offset by aerial distension, the pulse wave velocity increases and reflex waves to the hea arrive earlier, causing the systolic blood pressure to augment. Such an augmentation, together with decreasing diastolic blood pressure results in an enhancement of the pulse pressure. When the stroke volume is normal, an increase in pulse pressure is, therefore, a marker of altered conductance. However, if, due to loss of elasticity of the conductance aeries diastolic blood pressure goes down, increasing systolic pressure also protects against a decrease in mean pressure. Indeed, in conditions of elevated pulse pressure, the mean pressure can be normal or high, indicating that when evaluating blood pressure all components should be taken into consideration. A high systolic blood pressure associated with a normal mean blood pressure is suggestive of a normal peripheral resistance.'Diastolic PressureSystolic pressure is peak pressure reached during systole, similarly, diastolic pressure refers to lowest pressure during diastole.Diastolic blood pressure is an index to peripheral resistance.Elasticity of aoa and large aeries is mainly responsible for origin and maintenance of diastolic pressure (by Windkessel elastic recoil effect).Because the elasticity is higher in younger subjects, diastolic pressure is maintained and pulse pressure is narrow.Because the elasticity is lower in old persons, diastolic pressure is decreased and pulse pressure is widened.", "cop": 1, "opa": "Diastolic blood pressure", "opb": "Pulse pressure", "opc": "Systolic resistance in aoa as it increases in its length", "opd": "Mean aerial pressure, which is responsible for blood flow to an organ", "subject_name": "Anatomy", "topic_name": null, "id": "09692eda-4a95-4613-9855-ed141332239b", "choice_type": "single"}, {"question": "Commonest cause of raised serum calcium is -", "exp": "Ans. is 'c' i.e., Parathyroid adenoma o Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia overall. o The frequency of the various parathyroid lesions underlying the hyperfunction is as follows : ?

The major effect of coicosteroids is to switch off the transcription of multiple activated genes that encode inflammatory proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and inflammatory enzymes. This effect involves several mechanisms, including inhibition of the transcription factor NF-KB, but an impoant mechanism is recruitment of HDAC2 to the inflammatory gene complex, which reverses the histone acetylation associated with increased gene transcription. Coicosteroids also activate anti-inflammatory genes, such as mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1, and increase the expression of IQ-receptors.

Usually red blood cells are a standard size of about 6-8 pm in diameter. Certain disorders, however, cause a significant variation in cell size. Higher RDW values indicate greater variation in size. Normal reference range in human red blood cells is 11.5-14.5%. If anemia is observed, RDW test results are often used together with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) results to determine the possible causes of the anemia. It is mainly used to differentiate an anemia of mixed causes from an anemia of a single cause. Deficiencies of Vitamin Bl2 orfolate produce a macrocytic anemia (large cell anemia) in which the RDW is elevated in roughly two- thirds of all cases; however, a varied size distribution of red blood cells is a hallmark of iron deficiency anemia, and as such shows an increased RDW in virtually all cases. In the case of a mixed iron and B!2 deficiency, there will normally be a mix of both large cells and small cells, causing the RDW to be elevated. An elevated RDW (red blood cells of unequal sizes) is known as anisocytosis. An elevation in the RDW is not characteristic of all anemias; anemia of chronic disease,hereditary spherocytosis, acute blood loss, aplastic anemia (anemia resulting from an inability of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells), and certain hereditary hemoglobinopathies (including some cases of thalassemia minor) all may present with a normal RDW* The human erythrocyte is a biconcave disc, 7-2 pm in diameter, and has a thickness of 2-4 pm at the periphery and 1 mm in the centre* More than 90% of the weight of erythrocytes consists of haemoglobin.
